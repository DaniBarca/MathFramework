MathFramework
=============

A mathematical framework for vectors, matrices, and other utils.

This Framework works but it's not full tested yet. If you find an error please, contact me.

Be careful with Matrix [a][b] operator, works well but it will not assert surely that you are passing a valid Matrix position as the other operators does. Don't worry about Vector [a], it does the assertion.

To use this framework just put the MathFramework folder at your source folder and write: #include "MathFramework/MathFramework.h"
